Look for a command from the numpy documentation (or elsewhere on the Internet) to calculate the matrix determinant. The determinant is a number that does not require a deeper understanding here. Calculate the determinants of the matrices A, B and AB, where

A=\begin{pmatrix} 1&2\\ 3&4 \end{pmatrix}{,} B=\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 1\\ 5 & 7 \end{pmatrix}

and AB stands for matrix product. State that det (AB) = det (A) det (B) can be understood as the product of the numbers (the rounding error can be ignored).
