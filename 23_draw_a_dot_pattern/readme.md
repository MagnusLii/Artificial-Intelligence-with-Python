Read from CSV-file weight-height.csv to numpy-table information about the lengths and weights (in inches and pounds) of a group of students. Collect the lengths for the variable "length" and the weights for the variable "weight" by cutting the table.

Convert lengths from inches to centimeters and weights from pounds to kilograms.

Finally, calculate the means, medians, standard deviations, and variances of the lengths and weights.

Extra: Draw a histogram pattern of the lengths
