Consider the data from the file weight-height.csv.

1) Inspect the dependence between height and weight using a scatter plot. You may use either of the variables as independent variable.

2) Choose appropriate model for the dependence

3) Perform regression on the data using your model of choice

4) Plot the results

5) Compute RMSE and R2 value

6) Assess the quality of the regression (visually and using numbers) in your own words.

You are not required to split the dataset into training and testing sets. Of course you are completely free to experiment it here already.

It is recommended that you use the module sklearn for all your computations.
